# Car-counting-on-static-images-in-less-than-10-lines-of-code
The code uses YOLO_V3 library from cvlib which recognizes some common objects, including cars, used for this specific exercise in less than 10 lines of code.  Note that depending on image quality and car crowded images, results may have a low accuracy.

To use the code you could simply load the jupyter notebook file and follow the steps.

The first time you run the code, the model is to be downloaded from the YOLO site.
